# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
  admin = User.create([{ first_name: "Rails" }, { last_name: "Admin" }, { last_name: "christojohnsonv@gmail.com"}, { password_digest: "S@vin&s_#123" }, { phone_number: "+91 9496266110" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)
